/**
 * Base interface for streams, which are sequences of elements supporting
 * sequential and parallel aggregate operations.  The following example
 * illustrates an aggregate operation using the stream types {@link Stream}
 * and {@link java.util.stream.IntStream}, computing the sum of the weights of the red widgets:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     int sum = widgets.stream()
 *                      .filter(w -> w.getColor() == RED)
 *                      .mapToInt(w -> w.getWeight())
 *                      .sum();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * See the class documentation for {@link Stream} and the package documentation
 * for <a href="package-summary.html">java.util.stream</a> for additional
 * specification of streams, stream operations, stream pipelines, and
 * parallelism, which governs the behavior of all stream types.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the stream elements
 * @param <S> the type of of the stream implementing {@code BaseStream}
 * @since 1.8
 * @see Stream
 * @see IntStream
 * @see LongStream
 * @see DoubleStream
 * @see <a href="package-summary.html">java.util.stream</a>
